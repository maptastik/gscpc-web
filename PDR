Goals and Objectives

Our goal is to manage a farmland preservation program by purchasing conservation easements in the Rural Service Area of Scott County.  The target goal is to preserve 20% of the agriculturally-zoned land within Scott County, with an annual goal to preserve 2,000 acres per year.

PDR Program Overview

Scott County's Purchase of Development Rights (PDR) Program is the second Agricultural Conservation Easement program by a local government in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  Currently there are five (5) farms totaling 611 acres permanently protected by conservation easements.  Find out more about the program by viewing the following Powerpoint presentation:  PDR Presentation
