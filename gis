Geographic Information Systems (GIS)	 
Back to Home Page

GIS is a computer technology that combines mapping and information stored as data to generate maps and reports, and provide a systematic approach to collecting and managing information.

GIS information is organized into layers and the Georgetown-Scott County GIS department manages, updates, and maintains almost 100 layers for the benefit of all city and county governmental agencies to better serve the public. This information can be analyzed, combined, and queried to answer questions and to produce cartographic maps.
